    "summary": "After my 2 years of Army service. I earned a degree in Theater and spent 16 years working my way up through the ranks of production and administration.  A few years back I attained the position of Production Manager and, for a while, Interim Managing Director for a regional theater company in DC.  As my passion for coding grew, the time felt right to take on the new challenge of making it a career. In my spare time I enjoy adding new technologies to my skill set. I also enjoy swing dancing, sports, crafts, hiking, baking, and escape rooms.",
